# Investment Beginnings
I want this to be a general place where I collect my investment thoughts. I believe this will be an ever evolving document, however I also think that over time I may be able to create some models and thoughts that may help me improve my strategies and help me grow my portfolio over time.

# Investment Philosophies
1. Don't be greedy.
1. Fail quickly, be quick to take a loss.
1. Be slow to take a profit.
1. Be Humble.
   1. There is always someone smarter than me. So often my strategy is to find a person or fund that is smarter than me and make a small invenstment in them. I limit my risk but I do try to give to people doing great things. I often find that type of karma works well for me.
1. Don't time markets. Understand Positions.
1. Assets - Liabilits = Networth
1. Keep things simple.
